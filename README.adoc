This is demonstration of using KFSM to create an FSM for use in the UI.
We are using the classic Turnstile FSM. The UI provides for creating multiple instances.

== Running
* `./gradlew run` - Starts a webpack dev server on port 3000.

This project also demonstrates how to configure the `kfsm-viz-plugin` to create a state-diagram and a state-map
